description:  I built this to film dynamic shots of things I make for my Youtube channel. I used a lazy-susan, a micro-servo whicih I converted to be continuous rotation, a servo tester to control the speed, and a small lipo battery. This design is super low profile, compact, elegant, torquey, and totally portable!
