description: One of my earliest experiments with robotics arms, this is a robotic arm that I made using two Lego NXT bricks and 6 servo motors. It is not super precise but it has lots of maneuverability with 5 degrees of freedom. It can be manually controlled by touch sensors and the NXT buttons. At this age, I did not yet know how to do inverse kinematics, so I didn't develop any form of end-effector control.
