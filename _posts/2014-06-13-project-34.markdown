description: When I first discovered this physcial phenoma, that you can move water with electricity and magnetism, I was enthralled. I was much less excited when I realized why this technology has not gained traction in the industry- it takes a lot of power to produce a little force, so scaling the technology to have enough thrust to power a boat is not economically feasible.
