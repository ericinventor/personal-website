description: I was hired by small biotech startup to design and build first prototypes for their first product, a COVID rapid test scanner. This involved integrating an Arducam Pico4ML microcontroller, SD card reader, lipo battery shield, buttons, LEDs, and other electronics into a device that could capture an image of the rapid test, feed the image into a neural network to determine the test result, and then display the results to the user and log the results to an sd card. I designed the deviceâ€™s graphical user interface (GUI) and wrote embedded C++ software to integrate all electronics. I also used designed the test unit casings over many iterations using CAD and 3D printing.
