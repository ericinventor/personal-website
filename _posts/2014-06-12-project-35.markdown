description: This was a robot we made for one of our electrical and computer engineering classes at Cornell. The goal was for it to autonomously naviagte a maze, and also detect the location of treasure (indicated by specific RF frequencies). This robot, I designed and 3D printed/laser cut all the mechanical components, including the frame, wheels, and sensor mounts. I implemented single point lidar time-of-flight sensors to detect the walls of the maze. I also did the software integration of the light sensors used for line following.
