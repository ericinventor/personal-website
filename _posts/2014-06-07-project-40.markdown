description: My TV was blocking all the natural light in my living room, so I made it come out of the ceiling. I used a high-torque geared motor and winch design to fold the TV up and down from a small sub frame mounted to the ceiling. I used an ESP32 wifi-enabled microcontroller to control the motor using a 2ch relay module. The TV can be controlled by a wireless remote I built using another ESP32 microcontroller, or using buttons on the back of the TV.
