about:
  name: Eric Berg
  title: Systems Engineer
  body: Hi, I'm Eric. <br><br>  When I was a kid, my basement workshop was full of my grandfather's tools so I had everything I needed to build whatever I could imagine. I grew up tinkering, building small electric vehicles, and playing with Lego robotics sets. I went on to pursue my interest in engineering at Cornell University, where I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2019. In college, I was a part of multiple engineering project teams including the Baja Racing Team, and my own team that competed in a NASA Micro-g Tools Competition. After graduating, I went on to get my a Masters of Engineering in Systems Engineering also from Cornell while working full time at a large aerospace company. <br><br> Now, I am a multidisciplinary engineer with 4 years of skills and experience in electrical, mechanical, software, and systems fields. I’ve held roles in automotive, aerospace, and mobile machinery industries both domestically and abroad. My entrepreneurial spirit has led me into multiple startups including my own, where I’ve developed an understanding for customer-centric business strategy. I enjoy developing a strong business case and leading teams to create targeted and creative solutions, especially in the field of robotics. I excel in fast-paced, collaborative, multidisciplinary environments focused on innovation and new business.
